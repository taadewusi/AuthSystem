I am trying to deploy the AuthSystem App to render.com for free but I keep having error

error: failed to solve: failed to read dockerfile: open Dockerfile: no such file or directory
error: exit status 1

This error indicates that Render.com is looking for a Dockerfile in your repository root, but it can't find one. Here are the most common solutions:
Check Your Repository Structure

First, make sure you have a Dockerfile in the root directory of your repository (same level as your package.json or main application files). The filename should be exactly Dockerfile (no extension, capital D).
Create a Dockerfile

If you don't have a Dockerfile, you'll need to create one. For a typical Node.js application, here's a basic Dockerfile:
dockerfile

FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]

Alternative: Use Render's Auto-Deploy

If you don't want to use Docker, you can configure Render to deploy directly without a Dockerfile:

    In your Render dashboard, when creating the service
    Choose "Web Service"
    Set the Build Command to something like: npm install
    Set the Start Command to: npm start or whatever command runs your app
    Make sure the Environment is set to "Node" (not Docker)

Check Render Service Settings

If you already created the service:

    Go to your service settings in Render
    Under "Build & Deploy"
    Change the Environment from "Docker" to "Node" (or whatever your app uses)
    Set appropriate build and start commands

Verify File Case Sensitivity

Make sure your file is named exactly Dockerfile (not dockerfile or DockerFile). Git and Render are case-sensitive.

Which approach would work best for your AuthSystem app? Do you have a package.json file, and what type of application is it (Node.js, Python, etc.)?

it is a .Net 8 Application and below is my app i pushed to git and render has access to

I can see you have a .NET 8 application with a Dockerfile already present in your AuthSystem.API project. The issue is likely that Render is looking for the Dockerfile in the repository root, but yours is located inside the AuthSystem.API subfolder.

Here are two solutions:
Solution 1: Move Dockerfile to Repository Root (Recommended)

    Copy the Dockerfile from AuthSystem.API/Dockerfile to the root of your repository (same level as the Solution file)
    Update the Dockerfile to account for the new path structure:

dockerfile

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8080

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["AuthSystem.API/AuthSystem.API.csproj", "AuthSystem.API/"]
COPY ["AuthSystem.Application/AuthSystem.Application.csproj", "AuthSystem.Application/"]
COPY ["AuthSystem.Domain/AuthSystem.Domain.csproj", "AuthSystem.Domain/"]
COPY ["AuthSystem.Infrastructure/AuthSystem.Infrastructure.csproj", "AuthSystem.Infrastructure/"]
RUN dotnet restore "AuthSystem.API/AuthSystem.API.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/AuthSystem.API"
RUN dotnet build "AuthSystem.API.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "AuthSystem.API.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "AuthSystem.API.dll"]

Solution 2: Configure Render's Docker Context

In your Render service settings:

    Go to Settings ? Build & Deploy
    Set Docker Context Directory to AuthSystem.API
    Set Dockerfile Path to Dockerfile

Additional Render Configuration

Make sure your Render service is configured as:

    Environment: Docker
    Region: Choose closest to your users
    Instance Type: Free (for testing)

After making these changes, trigger a new deploy in Render. The first solution (moving Dockerfile to root) is usually more reliable for multi-project .NET solutions.

Which solution would you prefer to try first?
